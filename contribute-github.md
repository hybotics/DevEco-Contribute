These are the DevEco guidlines for contributing to our git repos

1. Fork the repo you want to contribute to
 - Click the [Fork] button on the repo you want to fork
 - Enter a name for your fork of this repo
 - Click the [Create Fork] button to create your fork
 - You will be taken to your new fork.
 - Clone your forked repo
 - cd to the directory of your forked repo
 - Set a remote for your forked repo
   ##### Do the command "git remote add <nick> <url>" where <nick> is an identifier for this remote and <url> is the master URL of the repo you forked

2. Download your fork of the repo to your computer

3. Set a remote to the original repo you forked: git remote add <name> <url of master repo>

#### The <name> can be anything resonable such, as your nick on our discord for instance
#### The <url of master repo> is the URL of the repo you forked. You can get this by going to the repo and clicking the [Code] button and copying it

4. You will need to create a GPG key so you can sign your commits.
