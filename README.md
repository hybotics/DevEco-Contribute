 5. HOME:

 #### Think of this as the front door of the Developer's Ecosystem. Start reading chats and interacting with other menbers here. You can get a good feel for the Community here by reading before you make your first post.

  - #chat

 #### This is where everything starts! We meet up with other members and find out what is new and exciting. Feel free to exchange information with others and start your own chat topics. If a single topic generates a lot of traffic on a regular basis, that topic might be split off into is own topic-specific channel. If you want to discuss things that are not necessarily developer related, try the #off-topic channel. This channel is for discussing developer topics that DO NOT already have a channel. Smaller communities and topics that are still developer related.

  - #introductions

 #### A place to introduce yourself to the DevEco community and let us know what you are interested in.

  - #off-topic

 #### Sometimes, we want to chat about stuff that is not necessarily a developer topic but it is still important to us. That is what we can do right here! This channel is for "personal" topics. If you want to talk about something that IS NOT developer related, it should be done at the water cooler. Examples of ‚Å†off-topic discussions include "today is my birthday!" and/or "I had a baby!" and/or "I don't like the color blue" and/or ... I think you all get the point.

 #### This is not to say that "watercooler" talk can not happen in any other channel, that is totally fine... But, if you are going to have a full blown discussion about something that is on a more personal level, take it to the watercooler.
